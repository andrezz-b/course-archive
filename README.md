# Course Archive

## Introduction
The Course Archive project is a user-managed platform that allows users to access and manage course materials from different colleges and study programs. Users can select a college, choose a study program within that college, and then view the available courses for that program.

For each coruse you will be able to see materials like lectures, questions, presentation... from previous years. For question like materials users will be able to submit solutions which will then be voted on by other users.

The project will feature a fine grained role system which will allow users to see only resources which they are permitted to see.
